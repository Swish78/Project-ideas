Project Title: Sentiment Analysis Web App

Project Description:

This project aims to develop a web application that can perform sentiment analysis on text input and classify it as positive, negative, or neutral. The application will use a pre-trained machine learning model to perform the analysis and will display the results to the user.


To accomplish this, the following steps can be taken:

Dataset Collection and Cleaning: Collect a dataset of text input and sentiment labels from a reputable source, such as the Sentiment140 dataset. Clean the dataset by removing any duplicates or irrelevant data.

Machine Learning Model Development: Develop a machine learning model, such as a Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, to classify the sentiment of the text input. Train the model using the cleaned dataset.

Flask API Development: Use Flask to develop a RESTful API that accepts text input and returns the predicted sentiment.

Frontend Development: Develop a user-friendly frontend that allows users to input text and view the predicted sentiment. The frontend can be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Integration: Finally, integrate the machine learning model, Flask API, and frontend into a single web application.
