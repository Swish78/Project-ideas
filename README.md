#Wine Quality Prediction and Recommendation System

Project Title: Wine Quality Prediction and Recommendation System

Project Description:
This project aims to create a web application that allows users to input wine characteristics such as acidity, pH, and alcohol content, and receive a predicted quality rating of the wine on a scale from 0-10. The application will also make personalized wine recommendations based on the user's input.

To accomplish this, the following steps can be taken:

Dataset Collection and Cleaning: Collect a dataset of wine characteristics and quality ratings from a reputable source, such as the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Clean the dataset by removing any duplicates or missing data.

Machine Learning Model Development: Develop a machine learning model, such as a regression model, to predict wine quality based on the input features. Train the model using the cleaned dataset.

Flask API Development: Use Flask to develop a RESTful API that accepts input wine characteristics and returns the predicted quality rating.

Frontend Development: Develop a user-friendly frontend that allows users to input wine characteristics and view the predicted quality rating. The frontend can be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Personalized Wine Recommendation System: Develop a personalized wine recommendation system that suggests wines based on the user's input characteristics and preferences. This can be accomplished using a collaborative filtering algorithm, such as K-nearest neighbors (KNN).

Integration: Finally, integrate the machine learning model, Flask API, and recommendation system into a single web application.
